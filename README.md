# Carthartic
An app that tracks and compares used car prices for car dealers. 

# Motivation
I want to create an API that searches for local used cars and gives resellers an idea of the comparable cars. The app intends to compare mileage, year, body style, and price so the reseller can price cars competitively. 

## UX & User Stories: MVP

**Login and Sign Up Page**

As a user, I want to understand what the app is so that I can decide if I want to sign up
and if so I want to be able to store my user information or return to the site to track my progress.
